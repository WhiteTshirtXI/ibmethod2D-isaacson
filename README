2D Cartesian Grid Immersed Boundary Navier-Stokes fluid solver. Uses a
periodic, square domain. Note, the solver does not handle wrapping of
immersed boundary structures across periodic boundaries.  You must
make sure that the structure stays away from the boundaries!

Numerical method is that of C. S. Peskin, "The Immersed Boundary Method",
Acta Numerica 11:479-517, 2002
